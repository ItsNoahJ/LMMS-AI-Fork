## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Current Challenges
1. **Model Size and Performance**
   - Challenge: TensorFlow Lite models can be large and resource-intensive
   - Solution: Implement model quantization and tiered loading based on available resources

2. **Real-time Audio Processing**
   - Challenge: AI model inference may not be fast enough for real-time audio processing
   - Solution: Implement pre-generation and caching of patterns

3. **Integration with LMMS Plugin System**
   - Challenge: LMMS plugin API may not directly support AI model integration
   - Solution: Created abstraction layers (AIPlugin, AIInstrument, AIEffect) to bridge the gap

### Resolved Challenges
- âœ… Created modular architecture for AI plugins
- âœ… Designed flexible model serving framework
- âœ… Implemented MIDI utilities for data conversion

## Next Milestone: MusicVAE Plugin Demo
Target: Complete functional MusicVAE instrument plugin with UI
Deadline: TBD
Key Deliverables:
- Working pattern generation
- Parameter controls for temperature, complexity, density
- Pattern visualization
- Integration with LMMS pattern editor
