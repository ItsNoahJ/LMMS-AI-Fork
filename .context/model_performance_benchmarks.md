## Conclusion

Based on these benchmarks, we can implement most of the planned AI features with acceptable performance on consumer hardware. Real-time features like groove modeling can be implemented with optimized models that meet our latency targets (<50ms). Interactive features like melodic completion require careful optimization but can achieve acceptable response times (<200ms). More complex features like style transfer and voice-to-song transformation are best implemented as offline processors with preview capabilities.

The most effective optimization techniques are quantization (particularly Float16) and model pruning at light to medium levels. GPU acceleration via Vulkan provides significant performance improvements for larger models but requires careful memory management.

For the initial implementation phase, we recommend focusing on the models that provide the best balance of performance and quality: MusicVAE (small), GrooVAE, MelodyRNN, and custom lightweight models for specific tasks.
