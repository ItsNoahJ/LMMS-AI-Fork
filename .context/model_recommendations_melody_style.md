## Conclusion

Based on our evaluation, MelodyRNN is the recommended model for melodic completion, offering a good balance of quality and performance with reasonable resource requirements. For style transfer, CycleGAN Music is the recommended model, providing high-quality style transformations with acceptable processing times for offline use.

Both models are compatible with our optimization strategies and can be integrated into LMMS with reasonable development effort. The alternative recommendations provide options if the primary recommendations prove unsuitable during implementation, while the implementation roadmap outlines a phased approach to developing these features.

It's important to note that style transfer represents one of the more computationally intensive AI features in our plan, and expectations should be set accordingly regarding processing time and resource usage. The implementation should focus on providing high-quality results with reasonable processing times rather than attempting real-time processing, which is not feasible with current models and consumer hardware.
