# LMMS-Magenta Integration: Next Session Focus

After reviewing the comprehensive integration plan documents, we've identified our current status and next steps for the LMMS AI Fork project.

## Current Status
- Git submodules successfully configured (LMMS, Magenta, TensorFlow, VCPKG)
- Initial directory structure partially implemented
- Basic CMakeLists.txt files created for some components
- README.md and some documentation created
- Utility classes partially migrated to the new structure

## Next Steps (In Order of Priority)
1. **Complete Phase 1 (Foundation)**
   - Finish directory structure setup according to the integration plan
   - Finalize the root CMake configuration
   - Create placeholder README files in each directory

2. **Progress to Phase 2 (Component Migration)**
   - Continue migrating existing components to the new structure
   - Focus on utility classes and model serving components
   - Update include paths and references
   - Create proper CMakeLists.txt files for each component

3. **Implement Build System**
   - Enhance the CMake configuration to align with the build system strategy
   - Implement dependency management using tiered approach
   - Add platform-specific optimizations

4. **Set Up Documentation Framework**
   - Implement MkDocs with Material theme
   - Create documentation structure with appropriate sections
   - Begin populating documentation with content

5. **Develop CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflows for code quality checks
   - Configure cross-platform build verification
   - Implement automated testing

In our next session, we'll focus on completing Phase 1 and beginning Phase 2 to ensure we have a solid foundation for the integration.
